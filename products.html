          <h3>Coin Days Destroyed</h3>
          <p>
            Coin Days Destroyed or 'spent coin days' is a concept that might
            sound complex at first, but it's actually quite straightforward. It
            doesn't refer to the spending of coins in the usual sense. So, what
            exactly is being 'spent'? This concept revolves around the
            significance of the age of Bitcoins that have been held in wallets
            for a long periodâ€”specifically, those held for 155 days or more.
            It's like saying each Bitcoin held for a day earns 'one coin day'.
            When these Bitcoins are moved to a different wallet, it's as if
            those accumulated 'coin days' are spent or used up.
          </p>
          <p>
            When we talk about high Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) data, it indicates
            that the Bitcoins being transferred have been held for a significant
            period before the move. It's important to understand that this
            metric isn't about the volume of BTC being transferred; it's about
            the time those Bitcoins have been held. In simpler terms, it's a way
            to measure the depth of commitment in the Bitcoin community, not
            just the quantity of transactions.
